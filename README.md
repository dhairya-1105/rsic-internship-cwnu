# CWNU Research Internship

This repo contains the evaluation and optimization of vision-language models (PureT, BLIP-2) on the RSICD dataset. The work includes:
- Baseline evaluation of PureT and BLIP-2 using metrics and model characteristics
- LoRA-based fine-tuning of BLIP-2 for remote sensing captioning
- Structural pruning of Q-Former and LLM layers to improve inference speed
- Metric-based evaluation of tradeoffs (BLEU, CIDEr, ROUGE, METEOR)
